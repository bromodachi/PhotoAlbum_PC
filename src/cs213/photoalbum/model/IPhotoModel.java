 *         IPhotoModel is the interactive counterpart to this interface. It is
 *         separated to make a distinction between a model operating on a single
 *         user. This is because during interactive control operations, the
 *         operations perform in the context of a single user; the administrator
 *         does not. Since the administrator model interface can access a list
 *         of users (with getUsers), using this for the interactive model would
 *         mean the interactive controller would have access to other users with
 *         requiring user input. This violates the user-by-user specification.
